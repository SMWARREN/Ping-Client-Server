# Ping-Client-Server
Javascript Packet Controller

> This program allows the user to create a Server and a Client. After the server is running the user will start the client, which will send pings to the client. If the client doesn't get the ping, its called a packet loss. This program demostrates what could happen if you ping a server, and tells information about how long the ping took and also tells if their is any packet loss.
